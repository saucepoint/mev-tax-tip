[Override fees](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/dynamic-fees) allow for per-transaction swap fees. The MEV-tax test-in-prod, will charge a maximum fee of 69 bips for the highest-priority-fee in a block. All other swaps pay a fee porportional the highest-priority-fee, with a minimum fee of 4.5 bips.

For example:

* Highest priority fee in a block: 1 gwei
    * swapper pays 69 bips

* A swap in the block pays a 0.25 gwei fee
    * swapper pays 17.25 bips (1/4th of 69 bips)

Test in prod, so I have admin permissions to set the default max fee and the default minimum fee ðŸ¤·
